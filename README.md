# Pandemic Spread Simulation

## Overview
The Pandemic Spread Simulation project models the dynamics of infectious disease transmission within a population. 
By simulating disease spread based on parameters like reproduction number ($R_0$), incubation time, fatality rate, and interventions 
(e.g., social distancing or vaccination), the project provides a platform for educational and analytical purposes.

The simulation enables users to:
- visualize disease spread over time.
- adjust variables such as population size, infection radius, and vaccination coverage.
- analyze the impact of different interventions on epidemic dynamics.
